# Djangonista

A lightweight Django + Tailwind (CDN) starter crafted for Hacktoberfest 2025 with the Django Cameroon community.

## Highlights

- 📦 Uses `uv` for blazing-fast dependency management.
- 🎨 Tailwind CSS via CDN with sleek directory and detail pages.
- 🗂️ JSON-powered data that seeds the database via focused management commands.
- ⚙️ Ready-to-run Django admin and tests for quick local verification.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Apply migrations and load JSON-backed sample data
uv run python manage.py migrate
uv run python manage.py seed_people --refresh
uv run python manage.py seed_communities --refresh
uv run python manage.py seed_schools --refresh

# Launch the development server
uv run python manage.py runserver
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` for the landing page, `/people/`, `/communities/`, and `/schools/` for paginated directories, or append a slug (e.g. `/people/yokwe-juste/`) for individual profiles.

## Project Layout
